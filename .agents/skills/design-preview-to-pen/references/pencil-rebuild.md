# Pencil Rebuild

## Preconditions

- The user has approved a preview direction.
- The design freeze card exists.
- The asset plan exists.
- The Pencil desktop app is running and connected to MCP.

## Mandatory Tool Sequence

1. `pencil.get_editor_state(include_schema: true)`
2. `pencil.get_guidelines(...)` when a guide or style is needed
3. `pencil.set_variables(...)` for tokens
4. `pencil.batch_design(...)` for section construction
5. `pencil.snapshot_layout(...)` for structural review
6. `pencil.get_screenshot(...)` for visual comparison
7. `pencil.export_nodes(...)` for external review artifacts when needed

## Rebuild Order

Use this order to preserve editability:

1. root frame and page bounds
2. spacing, color, typography, radius, shadow, and border variables
3. reusable non-page-level component structures and their key variants
4. major sections and containers
5. headings, body text, controls, cards, and navigation
6. icons and illustrations
7. decorative accents and polish
8. redline notes for Flutter handoff

## Designer Reconstruction Rules

- Use variables before large section passes so tokens stay consistent.
- Complete reusable component design before declaring the design draft finished.
- Name sections by their product role, not just visual shape.
- Name reusable components by product meaning and shared role, not by one screen position.
- Preserve the dominant, secondary, and support zones from the approved direction.
- Keep text and controls editable unless the freeze card explicitly permits rasterization.
- Translate preview-only artifacts into maintainable Pencil structure.
- Promote repeated controls, list items, cards, bars, and dialog patterns into reusable component structures when they are shared beyond a single page section.
- Use a consistent fixed viewport frame for page shells unless the user explicitly asks for another presentation strategy.
- When content extends beyond the viewport, prefer continuous frames if they materially improve the clarity of section order, sticky regions, or scroll transitions.
- When continuous frames are not used, add explicit scroll notes that make viewport, scrolling regions, pinned regions, and below-the-fold ordering unambiguous for Flutter restoration.
- Preserve HIG-baseline safe areas, tap targets, navigation behavior, readability, feedback, and accessibility.

## Recovery Rule

If `get_editor_state(include_schema: true)` fails because the desktop app is disconnected:

- stop before any Pencil write operation
- report the blocker clearly
- keep the workflow at the prepared state: approved preview, design freeze card, asset manifest, and rebuild plan

## Rebuild Principle

The target is not "same pixels by any means." The target is "same approved direction with maintainable Pencil structure."
