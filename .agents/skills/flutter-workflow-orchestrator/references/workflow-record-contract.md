# Workflow Record Contract

Use this reference whenever `flutter-workflow-orchestrator` initializes or updates project workflow tracking.

## File Path

Always use this path:

`docs/rd/00-workflow-record.md`

Create parent directories if they do not exist.

## Purpose

This file is the single stable source for project workflow state. It should let any downstream agent answer:

- what stage the project is in now
- which module is active now
- whether the workflow is waiting for user confirmation
- which stage and skill are queued after confirmation
- which artifact maturity changes are queued after confirmation
- what skill should run next
- what artifacts already exist
- whether taste direction exists and which constraints it introduced
- whether a shared or module design-source package has already been freeze-evaluated
- whether a module document is still a split draft, already implementation-final, or already landed
- whether the module design-source packet is frozen
- whether code has landed for the active module
- what blockers still prevent the next move
- whether `flutter-init` has already produced the scaffold and project-local `skills/flutter-dev/`
- whether the orchestrator is currently running in manual mode or `--auto`
- whether `--auto` is still actively advancing remaining modules or has reached a valid stop condition

## Initialization Rule

On the first orchestrator run:

1. Create `docs/rd/00-workflow-record.md` if it does not exist.
2. Fill every required section, even if some values are still unknown.
3. Use `not_started`, `not_selected`, `not_provided`, or `none` instead of leaving blanks.

## Required Metadata Block

Put this block at the top of the file:

```yaml
artifact_type: flutter_workflow_record
workflow_status: active | blocked | completed
execution_mode: manual | auto
current_stage: <workflow-state>
current_module: <module-name-or-not_selected>
confirmation_status: not_required | pending_confirmation | confirmed | rejected
next_skill: <skill-name-or-none>
pending_next_stage: <workflow-state-or-none>
pending_next_skill: <skill-name-or-none>
pending_status_updates: <module.field=target list-or-none>
```

Use `pending_status_updates` as a short semicolon-separated summary such as:

`home.uiux_status=implementation_final; home.impl_status=implementation_final; home.design_source_status=frozen`

## Required Sections

Keep this exact order:

1. `workflow_summary`
2. `current_stage_detail`
3. `current_module_detail`
4. `next_action`
5. `confirmation_gate`
6. `blockers`
7. `global_artifact_index`
8. `module_status_table`
9. `decision_log`

## Artifact Maturity Values

Use these values consistently:

### `uiux_status` and `impl_status`

- `not_started`
- `split_draft`
- `implementation_final`
- `landed`

### `design_source_status`

- `not_started`
- `in_review`
- `frozen`

### `code_status`

- `not_started`
- `in_progress`
- `landed`

## Section Expectations

### `workflow_summary`

Summarize the project's overall workflow posture in 2-4 short lines.

Include whether the workflow is still in shared freeze, already in module draft split, already in active module UI/UX refinement, or already in implementation.

If `execution_mode=auto`, also state whether the workflow is still auto-advancing or has stopped at the implementation boundary.

If `execution_mode=auto` and not all target modules are implementation-ready yet, explicitly name which modules are still pending and which module is being processed now.

### `current_stage_detail`

Record why the project is in the current stage and what must become true before the stage can advance.

If taste direction is missing before detailed UI/UX refinement, say so explicitly.

If the active module still has `split_draft` docs, say so explicitly.

### `current_module_detail`

Record the active module, or `not_selected` if the workflow is still global.

Summarize the module's current `uiux_status`, `impl_status`, `design_source_status`, and `code_status`.

Mention the latest freeze decision or blocker for that module when it exists.

### `next_action`

Record the next skill, why it is next, and the minimum required inputs.

If the workflow is waiting for user confirmation, set the actionable `next_skill` to `none` and move the queued transition plus queued status changes into the confirmation section instead of pretending the next skill is already allowed to run.

If `execution_mode=auto`, do not hold the workflow at ordinary downstream confirmation gates. Auto-apply them until the implementation boundary or a blocker is reached.

If `execution_mode=auto`, `next_action` must describe the next real auto step for the same module or the next dependency-safe module. Do not write a pseudo-finished summary that leaves the remaining modules implicit.

If the workflow is `blocked`, do not point `next_skill` at the next process stage and do not preserve a stale queued transition or stale queued status change from a failed routing attempt.

### `confirmation_gate`

Record:

- `confirmation_status`
- why confirmation is or is not required
- `pending_next_stage`
- `pending_next_skill`
- `pending_status_updates`
- the user-facing confirmation target, such as which artifact pack, which document maturity upgrade, or which design-source freeze is under review

If the workflow is waiting only on artifact maturity changes and not a stage switch, keep `pending_next_stage: none` but still persist `pending_status_updates`.

### `blockers`

List blockers explicitly. Use `none` if there are no blockers.

If the workflow is waiting on approval, include `waiting_for_user_confirmation` unless a stronger blocker already exists.

### `global_artifact_index`

Track project-level artifact paths when known, such as:

- PRD
- global technical baseline
- taste direction packet
- module index
- `global-design-guidelines.md`
- `light-theme-freeze.yaml`
- `dark-theme-freeze.yaml`
- shared freeze evidence or freeze decision
- architecture summary
- Flutter project root
- `flutter-init` summary
- project-local `skills/flutter-dev/`

If the shared/public component freeze is tracked in a dedicated artifact, index it here too.

### `module_status_table`

Use one row per module with these columns:

| module | current_state | confirmation_status | next_skill | pending_next_stage | pending_next_skill | pending_status_updates | uiux_rd | uiux_status | impl_rd | impl_status | global_guidelines | light_theme | dark_theme | taste_direction | visual_evidence | design_source_status | code_status | init_status | blockers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Update the existing row for a module instead of creating duplicates.

Keep the row values on the last confirmed state. Proposed upgrades go into `pending_status_updates` until the user confirms them.

If `execution_mode=auto`, the table must make it obvious which modules are already at the implementation boundary and which modules are still pending pre-implementation work.

### `decision_log`

Append short dated entries only when a stage changes, a blocker is cleared, a routing decision changes, or a confirmed artifact maturity change is applied.

## Update Rules

- Update the metadata block on every orchestrator run.
- Keep `current_stage` and the active module row in sync.
- Keep `confirmation_status`, `pending_next_stage`, `pending_next_skill`, and `pending_status_updates` in sync between the metadata block and the active module row.
- If taste direction is produced, index its artifact path in `global_artifact_index` and link it from active module rows when relevant.
- If `design-preview-to-global-guidelines` artifacts are created, update the relevant module row and queue `global_guidelines_frozen` in `pending_next_stage` instead of switching immediately.
- If a freeze evaluation fails, keep the current stage unchanged, clear any queued freeze promotion, and route back to the correct upstream skill for exactly one scope-matched revision pass.
- If `execution_mode=auto`, the orchestrator should apply deterministic queued transitions and queued status updates without pausing for ordinary downstream confirmation, and it must stop only when the implementation boundary is reached or when a blocker appears.
- If `execution_mode=auto`, the orchestrator must not stop just because one module reached a local milestone such as `implementation_final`, `module_design_frozen`, `impl_rd_ready`, or `architecture_ready`.
- If `execution_mode=auto`, after one module reaches a local milestone, immediately update `current_module`, `current_stage`, `next_skill`, the active module row, and `decision_log` to reflect the next real pre-implementation action.
- If `execution_mode=auto`, `current_module` means only the module being processed now. It must not imply that the current auto run is scoped to that single module.
- If `execution_mode=auto`, `workflow_summary` and `next_action` must explicitly state which modules remain to be advanced. Do not imply that auto is complete while target modules are still pending.
- If `execution_mode=auto`, do not use a generic "recommended next skill" as a stopping placeholder when unresolved target modules still exist. The record must reflect active continuation, not deferred manual pickup.
- If the active module design-source packet is confirmed, queue or apply `design_source_status=frozen` according to the confirmation gate.
- If docs reference the frozen design-source packet and the user confirms, apply `uiux_status=landed` and `impl_status=landed`.
- If a step result is ready for review, keep `current_stage` on the last confirmed stage, set `confirmation_status: pending_confirmation`, set `next_skill: none`, and record candidate transitions and status changes in `pending_next_stage`, `pending_next_skill`, and `pending_status_updates`.
- If the user confirms a pending transition, move `pending_next_stage` into `current_stage`, move `pending_next_skill` into `next_skill` only for that routing update, apply `pending_status_updates`, clear all pending fields to `none`, and set `confirmation_status: confirmed`.
- If the user confirms only queued status changes and there is no stage switch, keep `current_stage` unchanged, apply `pending_status_updates`, clear all pending fields to `none`, and set `confirmation_status: confirmed`.
- If the user rejects a pending transition or pending status change, keep the current confirmed stage and maturity values, set `confirmation_status: rejected`, and write the rejection reason into blockers plus the decision log.
- If a step returns `blocked`, keep `current_stage` unchanged, clear `pending_next_stage`, `pending_next_skill`, and `pending_status_updates` to `none`, and do not rewrite the module into the next workflow state or next maturity level.
- If `flutter-init` completes, update the global artifact index with the project root, initialization summary, and `skills/flutter-dev/` path, then queue the relevant stage as `project_initialized` instead of switching immediately.
- If a module is blocked, write the blocker both in the metadata summary section and in the module row.
- If the workflow completes, set `workflow_status: completed`.

## Hard Rules

- Do not create separate workflow state files per module.
- Do not delete historical decisions from `decision_log`; append short entries instead.
- Do not hide blockers in prose outside the `blockers` section.
- Do not mark a stage as advanced until the required artifacts for that stage are actually available.
- Do not mark a maturity upgrade as confirmed until the artifact that proves it actually exists.
- Do not treat `split_draft` as implementation-ready.
- Do not mark `uiux_status=landed` or `impl_status=landed` before the docs reference a confirmed frozen design-source packet.
- Do not mark `code_status=landed` before code output actually exists.
- Do not treat a complete design draft as freeze-ready when the design package is still incomplete.
- Do not switch to the next process while `confirmation_status` is `pending_confirmation`, unless `execution_mode=auto` and the next move is still before the implementation boundary.
- Do not let `execution_mode=auto` stop because one module reached a local completed state while other target modules still remain.
- Do not let `workflow_summary` or `next_action` present a single-module milestone as if the whole auto run were complete.
- Do not hide the remaining auto scope in prose. When `execution_mode=auto`, explicitly say which modules still need advancement.
- Do not write `next_skill: none` as if auto were finished when the real state is "this module is done but other modules remain".
- Do not store an "auto completed" interpretation when the actual state is only "one module reached a local stable node and the next module has not been selected yet".
- Do not store a queued transition or queued maturity change only in prose; always persist it in `pending_next_stage`, `pending_next_skill`, and `pending_status_updates`.
- Do not keep `pending_next_stage`, `pending_next_skill`, or `pending_status_updates` populated after a `blocked` result.
- Do not rewrite `current_stage` to a later workflow state when the latest routing result is `blocked`.
- Do not mark `project_initialized` unless both the scaffold and project-local `skills/flutter-dev/` exist.
- Do not let `execution_mode=auto` enter `implementing` or set `code_status=in_progress`.
- Do not require `pen_file`, `pen_status`, page-level Pen, `.pen`, or Pencil MCP data in the default workflow record.
