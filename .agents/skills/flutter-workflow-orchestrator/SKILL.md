# Flutter Workflow Orchestrator

## Overview

Route a Flutter module through the approved PRD -> global technical baseline -> taste-first shared design direction -> taste-router text normalization plus static-evidence intake -> shared freeze -> split drafts -> implementation-stage paired `ui-ux.md` and `impl.md` refinement -> module design freeze -> implementation RD readiness -> architecture -> implementation workflow.

This skill is the traffic controller. It chooses the next specialist skill, records state, blocks skipped gates, waits for explicit user confirmation before promoting any stage or status change, and maintains one stable workflow record document for the whole project.

In manual mode, it may pause at a confirmation gate after one stage or one module reaches a reviewable milestone. In `--auto` mode, it must behave as a full-module advancement loop across the whole target module set, not as a single-module recommendation assistant.

The default workflow no longer requires Pen, Pencil, page-level `.pen`, or Pencil MCP data before Flutter implementation. Pen/Pencil skills may remain available as optional external design adapters, but this orchestrator must not route to them unless the user explicitly asks for Pencil tooling.

Before any global design freeze or module design freeze, always run `flutter-taste-router` to normalize the textual design packet first. After that normalization, inspect the matching artifact directories for static visual evidence. If the needed static image is missing, check `IMAGE_BASE_URL` and `IMAGE_API_KEY`. If either variable is missing, continue to the next workflow step without blocking on image generation. If both variables exist, call `gpt-image-2-generator` to generate page-specific app preview images, save them under the matching page or module directory using the corresponding page name, and when one module page is selected as the global reference, store that chosen global preview under `docs/rd/` and copy the same file into the related module directory. The global preview should be the module page that shows the richest overall app surface. All workflow preview images, whether generated or accepted as new references, must use light mode instead of dark mode unless the user explicitly changes that requirement upstream.

## `--auto`

This skill supports an `--auto` execution parameter.

When `--auto` is present, the orchestrator must keep routing and applying workflow transitions without stopping for any downstream confirmation gate, as long as the next move is deterministic and no blocker is hit.

`--auto` is a full-module advancement mode, not a current-module recommendation mode. It must keep working through the remaining target modules until every dependency-safe module has been advanced to the implementation boundary and no further pre-implementation move is available.

The `--auto` goal is:

- finish shared taste direction and shared freeze preparation
- run `flutter-taste-router` textual normalization before every shared freeze or module freeze decision
- inspect static-evidence directories before deciding whether image generation is necessary
- split modules
- iterate every module through paired `ui-ux.md` and `impl.md` refinement in `module_uiux_refinement`
- freeze each module design-source packet
- advance each module to implementation-ready document maturity
- continue until every target module is ready to enter implementation, but before any module actually starts code implementation

`--auto` is not allowed to:

- start code implementation
- mark `code_status=in_progress`
- switch into `implementing`
- bypass real blockers or missing inputs
- invent approvals for ambiguous design choices
- stop just because one active module reached a local stable milestone such as `implementation_final`, `module_design_frozen`, `impl_rd_ready`, or `architecture_ready`
- leave a module-complete handoff behind as a mere `next_skill` suggestion when other target modules are still not implementation-ready

When `--auto` reaches shared freeze or module freeze and static visual evidence is still required after the `flutter-taste-router` text packet has been normalized, it should first inspect the relevant directories for existing page images. If none are available and both `IMAGE_BASE_URL` and `IMAGE_API_KEY` exist, it should automatically call `gpt-image-2-generator` to produce the missing page-specific app preview images before continuing. If either environment variable is missing, it should continue with the normalized text packet instead of blocking.

Those generated page previews should be treated as:

- light-mode exploratory visual evidence for taste consolidation
- shared freeze input when one direction is selected
- optional module freeze input when a module-specific screen pack is still needed
- page-named evidence files that can be referenced directly by downstream implementation

The auto-generated previews do not remove the need for freeze-quality evaluation; they only satisfy the missing static-visual prerequisite.

## Auto Loop Contract

After `modules_split`, `--auto` must behave as a loop:

1. Select the next dependency-safe target module that is not yet at the implementation boundary.
2. Set that module as `current_module` and update the workflow record immediately.
3. Refine that module until its docs reach implementation-final maturity.
4. Run module freeze and freeze the design-source packet when the packet is explicit enough.
5. Advance the module to implementation-ready maturity.
6. Produce any required architecture output for that module.
7. Update `current_stage`, `next_skill`, `module_status_table`, and `decision_log`.
8. Re-evaluate the remaining modules and immediately continue with the next dependency-safe module.

`current_module` is only the module being processed right now. It must never be interpreted as the only module covered by the current `--auto` run.

If one module reaches `implementation_final`, `module_design_frozen`, `impl_rd_ready`, or `architecture_ready`, that is only a local milestone. In `--auto` mode, the orchestrator must immediately decide whether the same module still needs another pre-implementation step or whether another module should become `current_module`.

## Stop Condition

The default stop condition for `--auto` is:

- every module row has at least `uiux_status=landed`
- every module row has at least `impl_status=landed`
- every module row has `design_source_status=frozen`
- any required architecture outputs for those modules are ready
- the workflow is waiting at the boundary before module implementation

When this stop condition is reached, the orchestrator should surface that the project is `implementation_ready_waiting` and return control to the user or downstream implementation skill.

`--auto` may stop only when one of these conditions is true:

- all target modules satisfy the implementation-boundary condition above
- a real blocker appears and the current round cannot safely continue

It must not stop because one module finished its local pre-implementation flow, because a downstream skill recommendation was produced, or because `current_module` changed from one module to another.

## Workflow Record

- On the first run, always create `docs/rd/00-workflow-record.md` if it does not exist.
- Keep all stage bookkeeping in that one file. Do not split stage tracking across ad-hoc notes or per-module workflow files.
- Read `references/workflow-record-contract.md` before initializing or updating the workflow record.
- After every routing decision, update the record with the current stage, current module, confirmation status, next skill, blockers, pending next-stage data, pending status updates, confirmed artifact paths, and whether `--auto` is still advancing remaining modules.
- If `--auto` is active, persist that execution mode in the workflow record so downstream agents know why confirmation gates were auto-applied.

## Confirmation Gate

Treat confirmation as a workflow gate, not as a workflow stage.

Use these confirmation states:

| Confirmation Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `not_required` | The current routing decision does not need a fresh user confirmation before execution. |
| `pending_confirmation` | The current step has produced reviewable artifacts or status updates, but the workflow must not switch to the next process or apply queued status changes until the user explicitly confirms. |
| `confirmed` | The user has explicitly approved the pending transition or pending status updates, so the workflow can apply the recorded changes. |
| `rejected` | The user rejected the pending transition or pending status updates and the workflow must stay on the current confirmed state until the issues are resolved. |

When a specialist skill finishes and produces the required artifacts for a later stage or a new artifact maturity level, do not immediately switch to the next process. Keep `current_stage` at the last confirmed stage, set `confirmation_status` to `pending_confirmation`, record `pending_next_stage`, `pending_next_skill`, and `pending_status_updates`, and write `waiting_for_user_confirmation` into blockers if no stronger blocker exists.

When `--auto` is active, the orchestrator should auto-apply all of its own queued stage transitions and queued status updates instead of waiting for the user, until the auto stop condition is reached or a blocker appears.

In `--auto` mode, a queued transition for one module must immediately be followed by a fresh routing decision for the same module or the next dependency-safe module. Do not leave the workflow record in a pseudo-idle "recommended next skill" state while unresolved target modules still exist.

## Module Artifact Maturity

Track module-stage maturity in addition to `current_stage`.

### `uiux_status` and `impl_status`

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `not_started` | The document does not exist yet. |
| `split_draft` | The document was created during `modules_split` and only captures initial module intent, scope, and constraints. It is not implementation-ready. |
| `implementation_final` | The document has been refined during implementation preparation to directly implementable granularity and is waiting for design-source freeze confirmation. |
| `landed` | The document references the frozen design source packet and the landed status has been explicitly confirmed. |

### `design_source_status`

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `not_started` | No module-level design-source packet exists. |
| `in_review` | The module has visual evidence or a freeze packet under review, but it is not confirmed as frozen. |
| `frozen` | The module design source packet is frozen and confirmed for architecture and code consumption. |

### `code_status`

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `not_started` | Code implementation has not started. |
| `in_progress` | Code work is actively being implemented. |
| `landed` | Code implementation is present and the landed status change has been explicitly confirmed. |

## Workflow States

Use one state per module:

| State | Meaning | Allowed Next Move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prd_ready` | PRD or feature brief exists | `flutter-prd-rd-writer` |
| `technical_baseline_ready` | Global architecture, package stack, backend collaboration, and delivery assumptions exist without a taste-aligned shared UI direction | taste direction through `flutter-taste-router` |
| `shared_taste_direction` | Project-level visual posture, anti-template rules, information density, typography hierarchy, contrast posture, CTA model, motion role, and platform baseline are defined | `flutter-taste-router` or `design-preview-to-global-guidelines` |
| `uiux_draft` | Shared UI/UX direction exists but is not frozen | `flutter-taste-router`, `design-preview-to-global-guidelines`, or `flutter-design-freeze-gate` |
| `global_guidelines_frozen` | Approved screenshots or preview comps have been converted into frozen shared guidance, explicit global public component decisions, and dual-theme artifacts | `flutter-design-freeze-gate` |
| `design_freeze_ready` | The shared design packet plus required global freeze artifacts are ready for approval before module splitting | `flutter-rd-module-splitter` |
| `modules_split` | Detailed modules, paired doc paths, module detail cards, global baseline references, and module-level component skeletons exist. Each module's `uiux_status` and `impl_status` start as `split_draft` unless confirmed otherwise. | `flutter-rd-module-splitter` |
| `module_uiux_refinement` | The active module is being refined from split draft into paired implementation-final `ui-ux.md` and `impl.md`, incorporating taste, global freeze constraints, and page-level visual references when available | strictly call `@superpowers`, using `flutter-rd-module-splitter` contracts, then `flutter-design-freeze-gate` |
| `module_design_frozen` | The active module's implementation-final docs, visual evidence, component freeze, state matrix, and design-source packet are frozen and confirmed | `flutter-design-source-control` or `flutter-uiux-to-architecture` |
| `impl_rd_ready` | The active module's UI/UX RD and implementation RD are implementation-final or landed, reference the frozen design source packet and global technical baseline, and are confirmed as implementable | `flutter-uiux-to-architecture` |
| `architecture_ready` | Tokens, assets, components, screen plan, non-native visual asset strategy, and scaffold contract exist | `flutter-init`, especially once the shared public baseline is clear enough to initialize the project before feature-module code |
| `project_initialized` | `flutter-init` has created the project scaffold and generated project-local `skills/flutter-dev/`, but has not started any feature implementation code | project-local `flutter-dev` plus `flutter-project-guardrails` |
| `implementing` | Code work is in progress after the active module's design source is frozen and the paired module docs are no longer split drafts; execution must be strictly invoked through `@superpowers`, and display-layer work must inspect the corresponding page image through `$image-to-code` first when such evidence exists | strictly call `@superpowers` with project-local `flutter-dev`, `flutter-project-guardrails`, and `$image-to-code` for display-layer landing |
| `parity_reviewed` | Implementation has been checked against the frozen UI/UX source, theme artifacts, visual evidence, and required states | fix issues or mark `module_done` |
| `module_done` | Shared freeze is confirmed, module docs are landed, design source is frozen, code is landed, and parity review has passed | maintain index only |

## Routing Rules

1. Start by ensuring `docs/rd/00-workflow-record.md` exists. If it is missing, create it before any stage routing.
2. If `confirmation_status` is `pending_confirmation`, do not switch to the next process and do not apply queued status changes, unless `--auto` is active. In `--auto` mode, downstream confirmation gates are auto-confirmed until the implementation boundary or a blocker is reached, and the orchestrator must continue routing after the queued values are applied instead of stopping on the newly reached local milestone.
3. If the user explicitly confirms a pending transition or status update, promote the queued values, clear pending fields, and continue normal routing from the newly confirmed state.
4. If the user rejects a pending transition or status update, keep the current confirmed state, write the rejection reason, and route back to the skill that must revise artifacts.
5. If a specialist skill returns `blocked`, do not advance. Keep `current_stage` on the last confirmed stage, clear queued transitions, and record the blocker.
6. If the input is only a PRD, broad RD, or feature brief, use `flutter-prd-rd-writer` first.
7. If a global technical baseline exists but the workflow lacks shared visual posture, commercial design decisions, or anti-template constraints, route to `flutter-taste-router`.
8. Do not fully refine module UI/UX before taste direction exists. The safe order is rough module split -> taste direction -> module UI/UX refinement.
9. Before any global design freeze or module design freeze, always let `flutter-taste-router` normalize the textual design packet first.
10. After textual normalization and before freeze, inspect the expected artifact directory for matching static visuals. Prefer existing images over regeneration.
11. If approved screenshots, preview comps, or static mockups must become a reusable shared design-source contract with fixed light and dark theme values, use `design-preview-to-global-guidelines`, then record `global_guidelines_frozen` as `pending_next_stage` until the user confirms.
12. If the workflow requests shared design freezing but no reference screenshots or usable preview images exist, do not route to `design-preview-to-global-guidelines` immediately. First check `IMAGE_BASE_URL` and `IMAGE_API_KEY`; if both exist, call `gpt-image-2-generator` to create the missing page-specific app previews, otherwise continue with the normalized text packet and note that static visuals are absent.
13. All newly generated shared or module app previews must be light-mode visuals. Do not generate dark-mode freeze evidence unless the user explicitly requests a dark-only or dual-mode design cycle.
14. Before `modules_split`, treat design freezing as shared/public freeze only. Do not treat it as module page freeze or module-private component freeze.
15. If shared design has a candidate direction or a complete visual draft but no explicit freeze decision, use `flutter-design-freeze-gate` directly.
16. If `--auto` is active and shared freeze still needs static visual evidence after directory inspection, call `gpt-image-2-generator` only when both image environment variables exist; save the selected global preview under `docs/rd/` and copy it into the owning module directory, then continue through `flutter-taste-router` and `flutter-design-freeze-gate`.
17. If `flutter-design-freeze-gate` finds hierarchy, task guidance, typography, contrast, CTA clarity, or state coverage still weak, do not route to freeze. Allow one shared revision pass through `flutter-taste-router` plus optional preview regeneration, then stop unless the user explicitly restarts the design cycle.
18. If the shared visual direction has been approved but detailed modules and paired doc paths do not exist yet, use `flutter-rd-module-splitter`. Its first pass creates split drafts, not implementation-final docs.
19. If multiple feature modules depend on one shared route host, root redirect layer, tab shell, or shell-level state, allow `flutter-rd-module-splitter` to split an `app-shell` or `root-shell` module first instead of burying that responsibility inside feature modules.
20. If a module has been selected for implementation preparation and its `uiux_status` or `impl_status` is still `split_draft`, keep or promote the module to `module_uiux_refinement` and strictly call `@superpowers` to refine only that active module's existing paired docs while following the document contracts defined by `flutter-rd-module-splitter`.
21. In module implementation preparation, refine `docs/rd/modules/<module>/<module>.ui-ux.md` and `docs/rd/modules/<module>/<module>.impl.md` before attempting module design freeze. Do not freeze a module whose paired docs are not both implementation-final.
22. When module refinement produces implementation-final docs, keep `current_stage` at the last confirmed stage, queue `<module>.uiux_status=implementation_final` and `<module>.impl_status=implementation_final`, and wait for confirmation before design freeze. In `--auto` mode, auto-apply those queued updates and continue directly into module freeze for the same module.
23. In module freeze, static visual evidence is optional. If the active module has no static preview but the `flutter-taste-router` design packet is explicit enough, route that packet directly to `flutter-design-freeze-gate`.
24. If a complete active-module visual draft, preview pack, or implementation-facing design-source packet exists, route to `flutter-design-freeze-gate` before queueing `module_design_frozen`.
25. In `--auto` mode, module freeze should rely on `flutter-taste-router` to determine and consolidate module UI/UX. Do not require auto-generated static images for module freeze unless the packet is still too ambiguous to freeze safely.
26. If `flutter-design-freeze-gate` finds the active-module design package not yet strong enough to freeze, keep the workflow on the active module, update the active module UI/UX doc plus design packet and optional visual evidence exactly once, and stop without another automatic freeze pass unless the user explicitly restarts a design cycle.
27. When `flutter-design-freeze-gate` approves the active module design source, do not immediately mark it frozen. Queue `pending_next_stage=module_design_frozen`, queue `design_source_status=frozen`, and if docs reference the frozen design source packet, also queue `uiux_status=landed` and `impl_status=landed`. In `--auto` mode, auto-apply that promotion and immediately decide whether the same module still needs implementation-readiness or architecture output before switching modules.
28. If a frozen UI/UX source is about to be consumed by implementation RD or code, use `flutter-design-source-control`.
29. If frozen UI/UX, theme values, component rules, and visual evidence must become Flutter-facing tokens, assets, components, screen architecture, and non-native visual fallback decisions, route to `flutter-uiux-to-architecture`. Do not require `.pen`.
30. Do not move a module into `implementing` until `technical_baseline_ready`, `modules_split`, `module_design_frozen`, and `impl_rd_ready` exist for the module, confirmed maturity is at least `uiux_status=landed`, `impl_status=landed`, and `design_source_status=frozen`, and the required global public code baseline is already landed.
31. The required global public code baseline before module implementation must include at least:
   - app bootstrap and environment initialization
   - root router or route host plus root redirect policy
   - global dependency injection or provider scope entry
   - local storage baseline and persistence wiring
   - global error mapping and logging baseline
   - shared theme or design-token baseline required by the frozen design source
   - the shared shell layer when feature modules depend on an `app-shell` or `root-shell`
32. Add network baseline and API client wiring to the global public code baseline only when the project or target modules actually require remote data, API access, upload, sync, or other network capabilities. Do not force network infrastructure into purely local, offline, or static-flow projects.
33. As soon as the shared public baseline is explicit enough, prefer triggering `flutter-init` before feature-module code begins. The best trigger point is after shared design freeze, module split, shared shell or global public baseline clarification, and the first architecture output that defines bootstrap-critical inputs.
34. Bootstrap-critical inputs for that early `flutter-init` trigger include at least the global public code baseline, any required `app-shell` or `root-shell`, shared theme or token baseline, route host or redirect policy, storage baseline, error/logging baseline, and network baseline only when the project actually needs it.
35. Do not wait for every feature module to reach `architecture_ready` before triggering `flutter-init` when the shared baseline above is already clear enough.
36. When `--auto` is active after `modules_split`, iterate all target modules in dependency-safe order and continue refinement until every module reaches implementation-ready maturity, but allow `flutter-init` to run as soon as the shared bootstrap-critical baseline is ready.
37. In `--auto` mode, after one module reaches any local stable node such as `implementation_final`, `module_design_frozen`, `impl_rd_ready`, or `architecture_ready`, immediately choose the next valid pre-implementation action. That may mean continuing the same module, switching `current_module` to the next dependency-safe module, or triggering `flutter-init` if the shared baseline is ready and the scaffold is still missing.
38. In `--auto` mode, after a module becomes locally complete for the current step, immediately update `current_module`, `current_stage`, `next_skill`, `module_status_table`, and `decision_log` to reflect the next remaining work. Do not leave `next_skill` as a passive future suggestion if unresolved target modules still exist.
39. If a module dependency prevents the next module from being refined safely, keep the workflow active but stop auto-advancement and record the blocker explicitly.
40. If the shared bootstrap-critical baseline is ready and the target project has not been scaffolded yet or does not contain project-local `skills/flutter-dev/`, use `flutter-init` before feature-module implementation begins. Do not delay this just because unrelated feature modules still lack later-stage architecture output.
41. `flutter-init` must stop at initialization boundaries. It may scaffold folders, shared bootstrap, shared wiring, and annotation-ready contracts, but it must not implement feature code, page code, or module-specific business logic.
42. If `flutter-init` has completed and project-local `skills/flutter-dev/` exists, record `project_initialized` as `pending_next_stage`.
43. If `--auto` is active, do not stop for `project_initialized`, `implementation_final`, `module_design_frozen`, `impl_rd_ready`, `architecture_ready`, or other downstream confirmation gates. Keep advancing until the implementation boundary is reached for all target modules or a blocker appears.
44. If `--auto` is active and all target modules are implementation-ready, stop here instead of entering `implementing`.
45. If implementation work should begin or continue, strictly call `@superpowers` together with project-local `flutter-dev` and `flutter-project-guardrails`.
46. During module implementation, split execution into `uiux` and `impl` tracks when the work naturally separates presentation from behavior or data contracts. Both tracks must still be executed through explicit `@superpowers` invocation, not by directly running downstream implementation skills on their own.
47. The default module landing order is: define the minimum data contract first, then land the display layer skeleton and main user path, then connect the real data layer. The minimum data contract should cover interface fields, state enums, loading or empty or error states, and interaction input-output boundaries without forcing full data-layer completion first.
48. For ordinary business-page modules, prefer `minimum data contract -> display layer -> data integration`. For infrastructure-heavy modules such as auth guards, route shells, sync engines, caches, payment orchestration, or backend-first flows, it is allowed to land the minimum process or data layer first and then attach display surfaces later.
49. Before display-layer code begins, run a display-layer readiness preflight. At minimum, verify:
   - the page has a readable main preview image
   - complex areas have readable detail previews when needed
   - `ui-ux.md` explicitly records scroll, list, overlay, layout, sticky, and component-repeatability semantics
   - `flutter-uiux-to-architecture` has already produced a concrete display-layer decision table
   - non-native visual effects are already classified as native code or asset fallback
50. During display-layer implementation, keep taste guidance active as a guardrail for hierarchy, spacing, typography, contrast, CTA salience, motion restraint, and anti-template composition. Taste must not override frozen UI/UX intent. If corresponding page images exist, inspect them through `$image-to-code` before landing display-layer code.
51. Treat preview images as visual-structure evidence, not as the only source of truth for Flutter implementation choices. Final scroll, list, sticky, overlay, and layout decisions must follow the combination of `ui-ux.md`, `impl.md`, and `flutter-uiux-to-architecture`.
52. If the page effect image contains a bitmap visual, texture, illustration, composite, or other effect that Flutter cannot reproduce natively with reasonable cost and fidelity, do not force a code-only rebuild. Record it as a generated asset requirement, use `$imagegen` to generate the needed bitmap asset, move the selected result into the project, and let implementation consume that asset explicitly.
53. Only use `$imagegen` for visuals that are genuinely better as raster assets. Do not use it for shapes, simple gradients, icons that belong to an existing vector system, or effects that Flutter can reproduce cleanly with native code.
54. If code is complete or screenshots exist, use `flutter-design-parity-reviewer`.
55. If the user requests UI, layout, interaction, hierarchy, visual token, or state changes after shared freeze or module design freeze, use `flutter-design-source-control`.
56. Only route to Pen/Pencil skills when the user explicitly requests Pencil tooling or provides a `.pen` workflow. That optional path must not become a default gate for Flutter implementation.

## Hard Rules

- Do not split implementation modules from a raw PRD before a global technical baseline and package stack exist.
- Do not use `flutter-prd-rd-writer` for detailed module design.
- Do not skip taste direction before detailed module UI/UX refinement.
- Do not skip `flutter-taste-router` textual normalization before any shared freeze or module freeze check.
- Do not generate new static visuals before checking whether the target directories already contain usable page images.
- Do not accept or generate dark-mode effect images as the default workflow reference set; the default preview baseline is light mode.
- Do not let shared freeze before `modules_split` claim that module pages or module-private components are frozen.
- Do not treat `modules_split` output as implementation-ready.
- Do not attempt module freeze before both paired module docs, `ui-ux.md` and `impl.md`, have been refined to implementation-final maturity.
- Do not let code implementation begin before `technical_baseline_ready`, `modules_split`, `module_design_frozen`, and `impl_rd_ready` exist for the module.
- Do not let code implementation begin while `uiux_status` or `impl_status` is still `split_draft`.
- Do not let a feature module start landing before the required global public code baseline is present.
- Do not force a network baseline into projects or modules that do not require remote data or network capabilities.
- Do not postpone `flutter-init` until every feature module is fully architecture-ready when the shared bootstrap-critical baseline is already sufficient to initialize the project.
- Do not let `flutter-init` implement feature pages, feature business flows, or module-specific behavior while initializing the project.
- Do not mark `uiux_status=landed` or `impl_status=landed` until the docs reference a confirmed frozen design-source packet.
- Do not start ordinary page-module implementation by fully building the data layer first when a minimum contract is enough to unblock the display layer.
- Do not mark `code_status=landed` until code output exists and the landed status change has been explicitly confirmed.
- Do not route around `flutter-design-freeze-gate` on implied approval.
- Do not let a complete shared or module design draft skip `flutter-design-freeze-gate` before freeze.
- Do not allow design packages with unresolved hierarchy, task guidance, typography, contrast, CTA, or state-coverage defects to advance into shared freeze or module design freeze.
- Do not let `--auto` cross the boundary into `implementing`.
- Do not let `--auto` skip blockers, unresolved dependencies, or missing design inputs.
- Do not let `--auto` pretend a module is implementation-ready when its docs are still `split_draft` or its design source is not frozen.
- Do not stop `--auto` for ordinary downstream confirmation gates before the implementation boundary.
- Do not stop `--auto` just because the current module reached `implementation_final`, `module_design_frozen`, `impl_rd_ready`, or `architecture_ready` while other target modules still remain.
- Do not treat `current_module` as the only module covered by an `--auto` run; it is only the module currently being processed.
- Do not leave `next_skill` as a passive handoff recommendation after a local module milestone when `execution_mode=auto` and more target modules are still pending.
- Do not skip directory inspection and environment-variable checks before auto-generating static visual evidence in `--auto` mode.
- Do not block the workflow on static image generation when `IMAGE_BASE_URL` or `IMAGE_API_KEY` is missing; continue with the normalized text packet instead.
- Do not require static images for module freeze when `flutter-taste-router` has already produced a sufficiently explicit module design packet.
- Do not require page-level Pen, `.pen`, Pencil MCP data, or `pen_status` in the default Flutter implementation workflow.
- Do not let implementation rewrite design intent. Design changes after freeze must return to design control.
- Do not route directly from `architecture_ready` to project-local `flutter-dev`; new project scaffolding must pass through `flutter-init`.
- Do not let module refinement or code landing bypass `@superpowers`.
- Do not directly route module refinement to `flutter-rd-module-splitter`, `flutter-dev`, project-local implementation skills, or any other execution path without explicit `@superpowers` invocation.
- Do not directly route module implementation to `flutter-dev` or project-local execution skills without explicit `@superpowers` invocation.
- Do not start display-layer landing before the preflight inputs are complete enough to avoid image-only guessing.
- Do not let display-layer code land without consulting the corresponding page image through `$image-to-code` when such image evidence exists.
- Do not let preview images alone decide final Flutter widget strategy when documented interaction or architecture semantics say otherwise.
- Do not force Flutter-native reconstruction for visuals that are clearly better shipped as generated bitmap assets; route those through `$imagegen` and store them inside the project.
- Do not use `$imagegen` as an excuse to skip native implementation for visuals that Flutter can reproduce cleanly.
- Do not switch to the next process automatically after a specialist skill finishes; wait for explicit user confirmation whenever queued transitions or status updates exist.
- Do not ask an execution skill to do workflow bookkeeping that belongs here.
- Do not treat one module's state as proof that another module is ready.
- Do not create per-module workflow state files; keep stage tracking in `docs/rd/00-workflow-record.md`.

## Pressure Scenarios

- User says "implement this home page directly" with only a PRD: route to `flutter-prd-rd-writer`, not module split or code.
- User says "split modules first, choose packages later": block and require baseline architecture and package decisions.
- User says "refine UI/UX first, taste later": block detailed refinement; require rough split plus taste direction first.
- User says "the design draft is complete, just freeze it": route to `flutter-design-freeze-gate`.
- User says "the shared effect image looks close enough, just freeze it": block and route back through exactly one shared revision pass, then stop.
- User says "modules are split, now refine only the home module": keep the active module in `module_uiux_refinement` and strictly route to `@superpowers` for focused paired-doc refinement using the `flutter-rd-module-splitter` contract.
- User asks why a root navigation host was split separately: explain that an `app-shell` module is valid when shared route hosting, root redirects, or shell-level state has independent implementation value.
- User says "the docs are final, start coding": require explicit confirmation for queued `implementation_final` and design-source freeze updates before code.
- User says "run `flutter-workflow-orchestrator --auto`": keep advancing through shared freeze, module split, per-module paired-doc refinement, module freeze, implementation-readiness preparation, and any required architecture output for every dependency-safe target module until all target modules are waiting at the implementation boundary, then stop before code. Before each freeze, normalize text through `flutter-taste-router`, inspect static-image directories, and only generate missing page images when the image environment variables are present.
- User says "use a dark-mode preview as the workflow reference": treat that as a special override request. The default workflow reference previews remain light mode unless the user explicitly changes the design requirement.
- User says "this module is done, what next": if `--auto` is active and other target modules still remain, do not stop to ask. Select the next dependency-safe module, update the workflow record, and continue automatically.
- User says "why did auto stop after one module reached architecture_ready": treat that as incorrect behavior. `--auto` must continue unless all target modules are implementation-ready or a real blocker was recorded.
- User says "when should project initialization happen": explain that the preferred trigger is once the shared global public baseline and bootstrap-critical architecture inputs are clear, before feature-module code starts, not after every feature reaches late-stage architecture output.
- User says "where is the Pen file": explain that Pen is optional and not required by the default workflow.
- User says "adjust button hierarchy during implementation": route to `flutter-design-source-control`.
- User says "implement the screen layer now": strictly route to `@superpowers` and require `$image-to-code` to inspect the corresponding page image first when that image exists.
- User says "start implementing this feature module now": first verify that the required global public code baseline is already landed; if not, block module implementation and land the missing global code first.
- User says "this effect cannot be written natively in Flutter": classify whether it should become a project bitmap asset; if yes, route to `$imagegen`, save the chosen asset into the workspace, and reference it from the implementation plan instead of forcing a brittle code imitation.
- User says "the code is done, check whether it matches the design": route to `flutter-design-parity-reviewer`.
