# Flutter Workflow Orchestrator

## Overview

Route a Flutter module through the approved PRD -> global technical baseline -> detailed module design -> UI direction -> static-source freeze -> Pencil -> architecture -> implementation workflow. This skill is the traffic controller: it selects the next specialist skill, records state, blocks skipped gates, and maintains one stable workflow record document for the whole project.

## Workflow Record

- On the first run, always create `docs/rd/00-workflow-record.md` if it does not exist.
- Keep all stage bookkeeping in that one file. Do not split stage tracking across ad-hoc notes or per-module workflow files.
- Read `references/workflow-record-contract.md` before initializing or updating the workflow record.
- After every routing decision, update the record with the current stage, current module, next skill, blockers, and any newly confirmed artifact paths.

## Workflow States

Use one state per module:

| State | Meaning | Allowed Next Move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prd_ready` | PRD or feature brief exists | `flutter-prd-rd-writer` |
| `technical_baseline_ready` | Global architecture, package stack, backend collaboration, and delivery assumptions exist without detailed module breakdown | `flutter-rd-module-splitter` |
| `modules_split` | Detailed modules, paired doc paths, module detail cards, and global baseline references exist | `mobile-ui-design-coach` or `design-preview-to-global-guidelines` |
| `uiux_draft` | UI/UX direction exists but is not frozen | `mobile-ui-design-coach` or `design-preview-to-global-guidelines` |
| `global_guidelines_frozen` | Approved screenshots or preview comps have been converted into frozen global guidance and dual-theme artifacts | `flutter-design-freeze-gate` |
| `design_freeze_ready` | Design packet plus any required global freeze artifacts are ready for approval | `flutter-design-freeze-gate` |
| `pen_ready` | Approved design can move to Pencil | `design-preview-to-pen` |
| `pen_frozen` | `.pen` and UI/UX source are frozen | `flutter-design-source-control` or `flutter-pen-to-architecture` |
| `impl_rd_ready` | Module implementation RD references UI/UX RD, `.pen`, and the global technical baseline | `flutter-pen-to-architecture` |
| `architecture_ready` | Tokens, assets, components, screen plan, and scaffold contract exist | `flutter-init` |
| `project_initialized` | `flutter-init` has created the project scaffold and generated project-local `skills/flutter-dev/` | project-local `flutter-dev` plus `flutter-project-guardrails` |
| `implementing` | Code work is in progress inside the initialized project | project-local `flutter-dev` plus `flutter-project-guardrails` |
| `parity_reviewed` | Implementation has been checked against design source | fix issues or mark `module_done` |
| `module_done` | Module passes design and implementation gates | maintain index only |

## Routing Rules

1. Start by ensuring `docs/rd/00-workflow-record.md` exists. If it is missing, create it before any stage routing.
2. If the input is only a PRD, broad RD, or feature brief, use `flutter-prd-rd-writer` first to create the global technical baseline and package decisions without detailed module splitting.
3. If a global technical baseline exists but detailed modules and paired doc paths do not, use `flutter-rd-module-splitter`.
4. If a module lacks UI/UX direction, page states, or commercial design decisions, use `mobile-ui-design-coach`.
5. If approved screenshots, preview comps, or static mockups must become a reusable global design-source contract with fixed light and dark theme values, use `design-preview-to-global-guidelines`, then record the module as `global_guidelines_frozen` when the artifacts exist.
6. If UI/UX has a candidate design but no explicit approval, use `flutter-design-freeze-gate`.
7. If an approved visual direction must become Pencil, use `design-preview-to-pen`.
8. If a frozen `.pen` or UI/UX source is about to be consumed by implementation RD or code, use `flutter-design-source-control`.
9. If module implementation details are missing after splitting, return to `flutter-rd-module-splitter`; do not use `flutter-prd-rd-writer` for module-level detailed design.
10. If Pencil design must become Flutter-facing tokens, assets, components, and screen architecture, use `flutter-pen-to-architecture`.
11. If the module is `architecture_ready` and the target project has not been scaffolded yet or does not contain project-local `skills/flutter-dev/`, use `flutter-init`.
12. If `flutter-init` has completed and the project-local `skills/flutter-dev/` exists, move the module or project stage to `project_initialized`.
13. If the project is already initialized and implementation work should begin or continue, use the project-local `flutter-dev`.
14. If code is complete or screenshots exist, use `flutter-design-parity-reviewer`.
15. If the user requests UI, layout, interaction, hierarchy, visual token, or state changes after freeze, use `flutter-design-source-control`.

## Workflow Record Update Rules

- Always update `workflow_summary` with the latest project-level stage summary.
- Always update `current_stage`, `current_module`, and `next_skill`.
- Record blockers explicitly instead of hiding them in prose.
- Add or refresh artifact paths when new module docs, frozen theme files, `.pen` files, architecture summaries, project roots, or `skills/flutter-dev/` become available.
- Keep one row per module in the module status table and update that row instead of appending duplicate rows.
- When no module is selected yet, store project-level routing in the summary and leave module-specific fields as `not_selected`.
- Move the project or module to `project_initialized` only after `flutter-init` has produced a usable scaffold and generated the project-local `skills/flutter-dev/`.

## Hard Rules

- Do not split implementation modules from a raw PRD before a global technical baseline and package stack exist.
- Do not use `flutter-prd-rd-writer` for detailed module design; it owns global technical baseline only.
- Do not let code implementation begin before `technical_baseline_ready`, `modules_split`, `pen_frozen`, and `impl_rd_ready` exist for the module.
- Do not route around `flutter-design-freeze-gate` on implied approval.
- Do not let screenshot-based design freezing skip `design-preview-to-global-guidelines` when downstream skills need stable global principles or concrete theme values.
- Do not let implementation rewrite design intent. Design changes after freeze must return to design control.
- Do not route directly from `architecture_ready` to project-local `flutter-dev`; new project scaffolding must pass through `flutter-init`.
- Do not ask an execution skill to do workflow bookkeeping that belongs here.
- Do not treat one module's state as proof that another module is ready.
- Do not create per-module workflow state files; keep stage tracking in `docs/rd/00-workflow-record.md`.
- Do not advance a stage without updating the workflow record in the same response.

## Output Contract

Return:

- `workflow_record_path`
- `workflow_record_update`
- `current_module`
- `current_state`
- `next_skill`
- `required_inputs`
- `blockers`
- `allowed_next_actions`
- `forbidden_actions`

## Pressure Scenarios

- User says "implement this home page directly" with only a PRD: route to `flutter-prd-rd-writer` for the global technical baseline, not module split or code.
- User says "split modules first, choose packages later": block and require at least a baseline architecture and package decision.
- User says "the design is basically fine, make the Pen file first": require `flutter-design-freeze-gate`.
- User says "these previews are final, let Flutter use the colors directly": route to `design-preview-to-global-guidelines`, record `global_guidelines_frozen`, and then route to `flutter-design-freeze-gate`.
- User says "the architecture summary is done, start coding": if the scaffold or `skills/flutter-dev/` does not exist yet, route to `flutter-init` first.
- User says "adjust button hierarchy during implementation": route to `flutter-design-source-control`.
- User says "the code is done, check whether it matches the design": route to `flutter-design-parity-reviewer`.
- Workflow record is missing on a live project: create `docs/rd/00-workflow-record.md` first, then continue routing.
