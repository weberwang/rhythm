description: Use when Codex needs to generate concept art, design previews, UI mockups, hero images, marketing visuals, icons, or illustration drafts with gpt-image-2, especially when the request should run through a custom OpenAI-compatible base URL and API key loaded from environment variables and the output needs to be written to local image files.

# GPT Image 2 Generator

## Overview

Generate local image files with `gpt-image-2` through the bundled `scripts/image_gen.py` helper. This skill is a focused, generation-only extraction of the system image generation workflow, narrowed to repeatable CLI execution, explicit prompt shaping, and local file output.

## Quick Start

- Confirm both environment variables exist before running anything:
  - `IMAGE_BASE_URL`
  - `IMAGE_API_KEY`
- Start with a dry run when the prompt is new, text-heavy, or uses a custom size.
- Save single-image jobs with `--out` and multi-image jobs with `--out-dir`.

```bash
rtk python skills/gpt-image-2-generator/scripts/image_gen.py \
  --prompt "A polished mobile banking dashboard in a bright editorial 3D style" \
  --dry-run
```

## Workflow

1. Clarify the target artifact: subject, use case, style, aspect ratio, visible text, and anything the image must avoid.
2. When the request is broad or under-specified, read `references/prompt-patterns.md` and translate the request into structured fields instead of relying on one long freeform prompt.
3. Prefer the structured prompt flags when control matters: `--use-case`, `--scene`, `--subject`, `--style`, `--composition`, `--lighting`, `--palette`, `--materials`, `--text`, `--constraints`, and `--negative`.
4. Run `--dry-run` first for unusual sizes, `--n > 1`, or text-in-image requests so the payload can be reviewed before spending tokens.
5. Run the live request and write outputs to an explicit local path.
6. Report the output path, the final prompt summary, and any quality risks that still need a second pass.

## Command Patterns

### Single image

```bash
rtk python skills/gpt-image-2-generator/scripts/image_gen.py \
  --prompt "A clean fintech hero illustration with two devices on a desk" \
  --out output/imagegen/fintech-hero.png
```

### Structured prompt

```bash
rtk python skills/gpt-image-2-generator/scripts/image_gen.py \
  --prompt "Design preview for a premium sleep tracking app" \
  --use-case "Mobile App Store preview" \
  --subject "Three iPhone screens showing onboarding, dashboard, and bedtime routine" \
  --style "Premium product render with soft realism" \
  --composition "Front-facing triptych with centered hero focus" \
  --lighting "Soft diffused studio light" \
  --palette "Deep navy, cyan, coral accent" \
  --constraints "Readable UI hierarchy, no extra floating cards" \
  --negative "warped phones, unreadable text, busy background" \
  --out output/imagegen/sleep-preview.png
```

### Multiple images

```bash
rtk python skills/gpt-image-2-generator/scripts/image_gen.py \
  --prompt "Sticker-style mascot for a developer tooling brand" \
  --n 3 \
  --out-dir output/imagegen/mascot-set
```

## Environment Rules

- `IMAGE_BASE_URL` and `IMAGE_API_KEY` are required. Do not hardcode them and do not pass secrets through prompt files.
- `IMAGE_BASE_URL` should point to the API root, for example `https://your-endpoint.example/v1`. The script appends `/images/generations` automatically unless the value already ends with that path.
- The bundled script targets `gpt-image-2` only. If the request depends on transparent backgrounds, image editing, or a different model family, stop and use another workflow.

## Hard Rules

- Do not silently substitute another model when the request explicitly requires `gpt-image-2`.
- Do not send a live request when either environment variable is missing.
- Do not claim text rendered inside an image is correct unless it was visually checked afterward.
- Do not assume transparent output is available; this skill is generation-only and does not implement the transparent-background fallback path.
- Do not bypass script validation for custom sizes; let the helper reject invalid dimensions first.

## References

- Read `references/prompt-patterns.md` when prompt quality is the main bottleneck.
- Read `references/environment-and-outputs.md` when the endpoint format, output naming, or response handling is unclear.
